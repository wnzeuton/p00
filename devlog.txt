Relational Tables: The tables are now relational, complete with FOREIGN KEY indicators.
Clarified Key Names: Certain key names have been updated for better clarity.
Expanded User Table: The users table now contains numerous additional keys, which are detailed below.
User Authentication Module: Users can now create accounts, allowing their details to be added to the users database, including a hashed password and its corresponding salt for encryption.
