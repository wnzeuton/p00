Auto-incrementing IDs: All IDs now automatically increment upon insertion.
User Table Enhancements: The users table has been updated to include both “normalized_username” (in lowercase) and “username.” This allows for recognition of multiple capitalizations as the same while preserving the user’s preferred capitalization.
Relational Tables: The tables are now relational, complete with FOREIGN KEY indicators.
Clarified Key Names: Certain key names have been updated for better clarity.
Expanded User Table: The users table now contains numerous additional keys, which are detailed below.
User Authentication Module: Users can now create accounts, allowing their details to be added to the users database, including a hashed password and its corresponding salt for encryption.
Login Functionality: A login feature has been implemented and is functioning as expected
